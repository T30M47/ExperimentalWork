    <title>Benchmark of Concatenated Index</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Testing read response time with and without <strong>Concatenated Index</strong></h1>
    <p>The tests are done on different versions of the Proizvod table with columns naziv, cijena, opis, dostupna_kolicina, datum_kreiranja and datum_azuriranja.
    <p>Concatenated indexes are created on columns naziv, cijena and datum_kreiranja (Wrong index has opposite order and part index only contains naziv and cijena).</p>
    <p>You can run a test by clicking a button and after the test is done and You get a JSON response, You should return to the home page using the back arrow in Your browser.</p>
    <p>I used ab with -n 1000 and -c 3 parameters to do all of the tests.</p>
    <p>Some tests can last for a long time, so You should be patient (check if Your browser is loading)...</p>
    <p><i>If you have trouble with starting the test check if You have ab installed (Markdown on GitHub has instructions for installing.)</i></p>
    <p>You can watch "Time per request" for concurrent requests or percentiles above 90 for comparison.</p>
    
    <h2>Testing read response time with and without Index based on the size of the table:</h2>
    <p><strong>Looking for all data with specific values for naziv, cijena and datum_kreiranja on which the index is created.</strong></p>
    <p>First we check differences in response times on Proizvod table with small amount of rows (100) and there should not be a big difference because of the index.</p>

    <p>First we check the difference in response times on Proizvod table when columns naziv and cijena have a large number of different values and here there should not be any difference because the part index can reduce the number of rows for search.</p>

    <p><strong>Looking for all data with specific values for only naziv and cijena.</strong></p>
    <p>First we check the difference in response times on Proizvod table when columns naziv and cijena have a smaller number of different values (5000) on 100000 rows and here there should be a noticable difference because the wrong index cannot efficiently use queried columns.</p>

    <p>Then we check the difference in response times on Proizvod table when columns naziv and cijena have a big number of possible values (almost all combinations are unique) and the difference is also noticable but smaller because the wrong index can more effectively use the queried columns.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Concatenated index can definitely boost performance of some queries, but You should test it with Your specific queries and workload.</p>
    <p>All versions of concatenated index improve read response times in comparison to not using an index, but You should be careful when to use which and that was shown in the tests before.</p>
    <p>Here are some general situations where Concatenated and its types can be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Do not use Concatenated Index if You have small number of rows in Your database, it won't make any difference for queries that search all columns within an index it can even make response time longer.</li>
    <li>Part Concatenated Indexes can be as useful as Full Concatenated indexes based on cardinality of used columns within the part index for queries that search all columns within an index. </li>
        <ul>
        <li>If You have large cardinality of used columns, then the part index can search a smaller amount of rows because they are more different.</li>
        <li>If You have small cardinality of used columns, the part index will have to deal with duplicates</li>
        </ul>
    
    <li>Wrong ordered Concatenated Index can have bad performanse if You use queries that contain only some of the columns from an index.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Bigger cardinality of columns that are used for the query can cause the wrong index to have larger differences from full index than smaller cardinality of those columns.</li>
        <li>Bigger cardinality causes the wrong index on just some columns to search based on a bigger number of rows, while small cardinality causes duplicates so wrong index can be a bit faster.</li>
        <li>A very small cardinality can cause both full and wrong index have bad performanse if You use queries for returning all elements on just a part of columns from an index, because of duplicates.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If You have queries that search for all the columns from an index the order of columns is not important in SQLite because of the query planner and optimizer.</li>
</ul>
